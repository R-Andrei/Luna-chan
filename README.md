### About luna

Luna is an anime-themed discord bot with a bit of a nasty attitude, designed in a very specific way for my server. 

Feel free to use, but take a look at the code before, there's a lot of stuff there that only I might find useful. 

It has functionality that's specific to my discord user. ;)

### Setup and usage

Bot works with a local instance of *MongoDB* for various reasons. Maily storing some data used for commands and usage logging.

You will need a `.env` file containing your discord token, database name, port and address. (coincidentally I store my database in the db folder under logging but it can be placed anywhere on the device tbh)

Just do an `npm install`, then run `mongod`, and finally run the bot using the npm `dev` or `start` scripts.



*more info coming soon tm* ^_^
