### About

Luna is an anime-themed discord bot with a bit of a nasty attitude, designed in a very specific way for my server. 

Feel free to use, but take a look at the code before, there's functionality that's specific to my discord user. ;)

### Setup and usage

Bot works with a local instance of *MongoDB* for various reasons. (code should be easily editable for use with atlas)

You will need a `.env` file containing your discord token, database name, port and address. (Database is stored in the db folder under logging by default, you should edit the code if you have it outside the project root.)

:exclamation: The nasty bit of her attitude comes from private resources which I haven't shared. Those are files containing replies based on different actions and moods. All the types I've used for her behavior can be found in the imports for each ability, or the main message listener. 

To run the bot in dev mod, `npm install`, make sure your db is up, then run the bot using the npm `dev` or `start` scripts and pray all imports are there.
